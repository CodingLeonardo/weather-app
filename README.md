## Overview

### The challenge

This programming challenge consists of developing a web or mobile application that allows users to check the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days. The application must be able to detect the user's location to display the weather for their city by default, but it must also allow searching for the weather for any other city. The interface must display detailed information such as date and location, type of weather with its respective image, minimum and maximum temperatures, wind state and direction, humidity percentage, visibility and air pressure. Optional functionalities may include the ability to request the weather for the user's current location and convert the temperature between degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit.
